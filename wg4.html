      <h2>WG4: THE BIGGER PICTURE - EDI & OUTREACH ACROSS THE COMMUNITY</h2>

      <h3> WG4 leader: Melissa Mendes</h3>

<p>
  WG4 is responsible for the bigger picture of SCALES: how our science is communicated, who it
  reaches, and how inclusive our community is. Within the first six months of the Action, WG4 will
  develop a network-wide communication and dissemination strategy to maximise the impact of
  SCALES on all its stakeholders – including academia, policy makers, professional associations,
  industrial partners, and the wider public and media. This strategy will coordinate the launch of
  SCALES’ online presence (website and social media channels) and the collection of outreach
  materials from participating groups, ensuring that resources are shared, translated where
  necessary, and made accessible across different countries and languages.
</p>

<p>
  A key part of WG4’s remit is to design and support outreach activities that bring superfluidity and
  neutron-star science to new audiences. WG4 will collaborate with artists and education specialists
  to develop creative engagement formats, from school-focused activities to public lectures and
  planetarium content. The network aims to produce a dedicated movie on superfluids in
  astrophysics for distribution to planetariums across Europe, and to build an online archive of
  recorded public lectures from SCALES Training Schools, freely available via streaming platforms.
</p>

<p>
  In parallel, WG4 leads on equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) across the Action. It will
  coordinate events for early-career researchers (ECRs), provide career support within the
  community, and ensure that EDI-focused sessions and training feature prominently at General
  Meetings, Workshops, and Conferences. WG4 will highlight the work of ECRs, women, and
  researchers from historically underrepresented backgrounds on SCALES’ communication
  channels, with fair geographical representation, to offer a diverse range of role models. Drawing
  on the experience of community members and a dedicated EDI coordinator – as well as external
  EDI consultants – WG4 will oversee best practice across all working groups, helping SCALES to
  build a vibrant, inclusive research environment and a positive, supportive research culture.
