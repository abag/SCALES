      <h2>WG4: THE BIGGER PICTURE – EDI &amp; OUTREACH ACROSS THE COMMUNITY</h2>

      <h3>WG4 co-leaders: Melissa Mendes, Andrea Richaud</h3>

      <p>
        WG4 focuses on the broader impact of the SCALES Action by addressing equity, diversity and
        inclusion (EDI) within the superfluid research community, as well as coordinating outreach
        and dissemination activities. This Working Group has the explicit mandate to ensure that the
        scientific excellence pursued across the Action is supported by an inclusive, diverse and
        sustainable research culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        A central objective of WG4 is to foster interaction between researchers from different
        backgrounds, career stages and geographical regions, with particular attention to Young
        Researchers and Innovators (YRIs), women and individuals from underrepresented groups.
        By promoting balanced participation and leadership across all SCALES activities, WG4 aims
        to contribute to a more equitable and supportive scientific environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        WG4 will oversee and support EDI-related initiatives throughout the Action, including the
        organisation of dedicated sessions at General Meetings and Training Schools, the involvement
        of EDI consultants, and the development of guidelines to promote best practice in community
        building. These activities will be embedded across the Action to ensure that EDI considerations
        are an integral part of all scientific and networking events.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to its EDI mandate, WG4 coordinates the dissemination of SCALES research
        activities and outcomes to the broader scientific community and the general public. This
        includes the development of a communication strategy, the use of social media channels,
        and the design of outreach activities in collaboration with education specialists and artists,
        targeting audiences ranging from school students to the wider public.
      </p>

      <p>
        WG4 will therefore focus mainly on the objectives of:
      </p>

      <div
        style="
          margin: 1.5rem 0;
          padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
          border-left: 4px solid #f4c542;
          background: #fff7d9;
          border-radius: 4px;
        "
      >
        <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">
          Creating a diverse and inclusive research community, and effectively disseminating
          SCALES science to both the scientific community and the general public.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Through these activities, WG4 provides essential support to WG1, WG2 and WG3 by ensuring
        that scientific progress across all scales is accompanied by strong community engagement,
        effective communication, and a positive research culture that can be sustained beyond the
        lifetime of the Action.
      </p>
