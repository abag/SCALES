Summary of received offers: 

Juliane Handschuh:
- Option 1: If 1000€ is exclusive of VAT (total ~1200€)
I could offer a half-day workshop (9:00-12:30) focusing on knowledge transfer rather than deep competency building. We would:
Develop practical guidelines for communication when handling code of conduct reports
Work through several case examples together
Create a framework your team can apply going forward

- Option 2: If 1000€ is inclusive of VAT (net ~840€ for me)
I could offer a 2-hour focused session where we develop a 5-point framework for structuring these difficult conversations. To practice with specific case examples, your team could work through these together as peer learning exercises after the workshop - but that follow-up work would happen independently without my facilitation.

Anne Schreiter: 
I can work with 1.000 euros and can send you an offer with an outline of the contents/agenda for a one day online workshop.
