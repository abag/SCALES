      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This Code of Conduct applies to:</p>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>All meetings, workshops, training schools, and conferences organized under SCALES.</li>
        <li>Online communication platforms (email lists, collaborative tools, social media, etc.).</li>
        <li>Publications, outreach activities, and collaborative research conducted under SCALES.</li>
        <li>All interactions among SCALES members and with the broader scientific and public communities when representing the Action.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Treat everyone with respect, kindness, and professionalism, regardless of gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, career stage or any other social identity.</li>
        <li>Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment that enables open scientific dialogue and collaboration across disciplines.</li>
        <li>Communicate constructively – critique ideas, not people; listen actively; give others the opportunity to contribute.</li>
        <li>Recognize and mitigate power imbalances, ensuring that ECRs and underrepresented groups are encouraged and supported.</li>
        <li>Maintain scientific integrity: provide proper credit, do not commit plagiarism or falsification of data, and follow fair authorship and collaboration practices.</li>
        <li>Respect confidentiality when reviewing or discussing unpublished work or sensitive issues.</li>
        <li>Promote accessibility in meetings, materials, and communication whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Take responsibility for one’s words and actions; apologize and correct mistakes when needed.</li>
        <li>Uphold respect in science, even under strong disagreement, ensuring that scientific debate remains grounded in evidence, civility, and mutual understanding.</li>
        <li>Assume best intentions from all, and prioritize solving conflicts and misunderstandings with civil conversation and mutual respect.</li>
        <li>Use shared datasets, repositories, and numerical tools developed under SCALES responsibly, respecting licensing and citation requirements, in accordance also with the SCALES’ FAIR data and open-software deliverables in the Memorandum of Understanding.</li>
        <li>Refrain from using SCALES mailing lists, communication channels, or online platforms to advertise commercial products, promote private services, or pursue any form of commercial solicitation. Appropriate use of SCALES mailing lists includes sharing information directly relevant to the Action and its members, such as meeting links, event announcements, training opportunities, scientific outreach or educational resources, and job openings aligned with the scientific scope of SCALES. More detailed guidelines on the appropriate use of SCALES mailing lists will be provided separately.</li>
      </ul>
