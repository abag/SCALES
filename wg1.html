    <h2>WG1: Smallest Scales – Vortex Dynamics and Dissipation</h2>

    <p><strong>WG1 leader:</strong> Daniel Pęcak</p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>
      WG1 focuses on the smallest length scales of superfluid dynamics, where the internal
      structure of quantised vortices, such as the vortex core, plays a crucial role and must
      be explicitly taken into account. At these scales, vortex dynamics and dissipation
      mechanisms depend sensitively on microscopic properties of the underlying superfluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the experimental perspective, WG1 addresses the dynamics of a small number of
      vortices and their interaction with pinning sites. These processes can be investigated
      in detail in ultracold atomic gases and by means of tracer particles in superfluid helium.
    </p>

    <h3>Theoretical and Numerical Approaches</h3>
    <p>
      On the theoretical side, the smallest scales are studied using microscopic techniques,
      such as Quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide insight into vortex reconnections
      in quantum turbulence and enable the investigation of strongly interacting superfluids,
      including those relevant to neutron star interiors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Complementary approaches include numerical solutions of the Gross–Pitaevskii equation,
      as well as density functional and hydrodynamical methods. These frameworks allow for a
      systematic analysis of vortex dynamics and offer the advantage of being scalable and
      extrapolable to astrophysical systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Scientific Focus</h3>
    <p>
      WG1 primarily addresses the following open question:

      <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">
        How do vortex dynamics change across different fermionic and bosonic systems,
        and what is the role of the vortex core structure?
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      In addition, WG1 tackles microscopic aspects of the Action-wide questions concerning
      the forces acting on vortices and their motion through inhomogeneous media.
    </p>

    <h3>Role within SCALES</h3>
    <p>
      Together with WG2 and WG3, WG1 contributes to common Action-wide tasks, including
      the creation of shared databases of experimental results, the development of open-source
      numerical tools, and the definition of benchmarks and a long-term roadmap for the
      superfluid community.
