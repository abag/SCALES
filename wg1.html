    <h2>WG1: SMALLEST SCALES - VORTEX DYNAMICS AND DISSIPATION</h2>

    <h3> WG1 leaders: Daniel Pęcak and Giulia Del Pace</h3>

    <p>
      This WG deals with the smallest scales in the problem, on which the vortex structure,
      such as the vortex core, plays a role and must be taken into consideration when
      investigating superfluid dynamics. From the experimental side, this involves studying
      in detail the motion of a small number of vortices and their interactions with pinning sites.
      These processes can be readily examined in cold atoms experiments and with the use of
      tracer particles in helium.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a theoretical perspective, the smallest scales are investigated using microscopic techniques
      such as Quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide insight into vortex reconnections in the
      presence of quantum turbulence and are particularly well suited to strongly interacting superfluids,
      including those relevant to neutron star interiors.

      In particular, this WG will focus on the question:

        How do vortex dynamics change across different (fermionic and bosonic) systems,
        and what is the role of the vortex core structure?

    <p>
      WG1 will also tackle microscopic aspects of the Action-wide questions on the forces acting
      on vortices and their motion through inhomogeneous media.
